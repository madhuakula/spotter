## Security Categories

Spotter covers 10 comprehensive security categories:

- **Workload Security** - Container privileges, security contexts, capabilities
- **Access Control** - RBAC, service accounts, authorization
- **Network & Traffic Security** - Network policies, service exposure
- **Secrets & Data Protection** - Secret management, encryption
- **Configuration & Resource Hygiene** - Resource limits, probes, deprecated APIs
- **Supply Chain & Image Security** - Image scanning, registries, signatures
- **CI/CD & GitOps Security** - Pipeline security, shift-left policies
- **Runtime Threat Detection** - Anomaly detection, policy violations
- **Audit, Logging & Compliance** - CIS benchmarks, governance
- **Platform & Infrastructure Security** - Node security, control plane

## Quick Example

```bash
# Scan a live cluster
spotter scan cluster

# Scan manifest files
spotter scan manifests ./k8s-manifests/

# Output in JSON format
spotter scan cluster --output json

# Scan with custom rules
spotter scan manifests --rules ./custom-rules/ ./manifests/
```
